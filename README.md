A search engine that ignores big sites, to bring back that old skool internet vibe

I hope that we can move the internet back to the glory days, where small blogs and interesting websites ruled the landscape.  

A time before major websites consolidated everything...


TODO:

[] Make a basic web crawler & search engine
[] Add rules to the web crawler that SKIP all major domains (such as reddit)
